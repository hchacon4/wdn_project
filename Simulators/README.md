## Data Simulation
Download both the zip file and the Jupyter notebook.  
Install simulator using  
```
pip install [path to GerryR89-network-simulator-v2 folder]  
```
Note: Install can also be done by updating the folder path in the first cell of the notebook.  

Simulator requires a EPANET INP file. See [WNTR page](https://wntr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/waternetworkmodel.html) and [example EPANET INP file](https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR/blob/main/examples/networks/Net3.inp) for further details.  

In notebook, update input and output file paths and set parameters.
