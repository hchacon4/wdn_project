Colab is a temporary environment with an idle timeout of 90 minutes and an absolute timeout of 12 hours. This means that the runtime will disconnect if it has remained idle for 90 minutes, or if it has been in use for 12 hours [longer for Colab Pro]. On disconnection, you lose all your variables, states, installed packages, and files and will be connected to an entirely new and clean environment on reconnecting. source:https://neptune.ai/blog/google-colab-dealing-with-files"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":298,"status":"ok","timestamp":1655286777870,"user":{"displayName":"Hugo Chacon","userId":"09326270256433817317"},"user_tz":420},"id":"CZl-N7iuq70P"},"outputs":[],"source":["# gpu_info = !nvidia-smi\n","# gpu_info = '\\n'.join(gpu_info)\n","# if gpu_info.find('failed') >= 0:\n","#   print('Not connected to a GPU')\n","# else:\n","#   print(gpu_info)\n","\n","# from psutil import virtual_memory\n","# ram_gb = virtual_memory().total / 1e9\n","# print('Your runtime has {:.1f} gigabytes of available RAM\\n'.format(ram_gb))\n","\n","# if ram_gb < 20:\n","#   print('Not using a high-RAM runtime')\n","# else:\n","#   print('You are using a high-RAM runtime!')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VQzqACaz6D71"},"source":["####Model framework"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4101,"status":"ok","timestamp":1655286781956,"user":{"displayName":"Hugo Chacon","userId":"09326270256433817317"},"user_tz":420},"id":"YPV_XlfZFlI-","outputId":"baad54f8-d894-4dd2-f5d6-cff06791c8af"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Using cuda device\n"]}],"source":["%matplotlib inline\n","\n","import os\n","import torch\n","from torch import nn\n","from torch.nn import functional as F\n","from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset\n","from torchvision import datasets, transforms\n","\n","import pandas as pd   # For loading csv file dataset\n","import random\n","\n","import math   # Used for nan checking (math.isnan())\n","import numpy as np   # Used w/ pipe_to_pipeIdx file and graphics.\n","import pickle   # Used for loading reg_dict (stored w/ training data csv's;
